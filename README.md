This is my Second Homework in Computer Vision Course. This Homework consists of two questions as follows:

**Question One:** Video Panorama and Processing <br>
*Part One:* stitching two principal frames <br>
*Part Two:* panorama with five keyframes <br>
*Part Three:* imaging raw video to a reference frame <br>
*Part Four:* making background panorama <br>
*Part Five:* making background video <br>
*Part Six:* making fore ground video <br>
*Part Seven:* making the video wider <br>
**Question Two:** Camera Calibration <br>

You can find the description of the homework in HW2.pdf. <br>
Also the report for each question is in a notebook file in **notebooks** folder with the name of the question. <br>
We have two other folders, obviously the **resources** one containing raw data and the **res** one containing responses.
